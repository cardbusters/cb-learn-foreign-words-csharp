Coding Dojo - Learning Foreign Language Words with Small Application

As a new language learner, I would like to learn more words effectively so I can learn faster the new language, 

* I need an application which asks words to me so I can answer, it can be a console app.
* If the answer is right, it says „Right“ otherwise „Wrong“ 
* I would like to add/remove words in 2 languages by myself to a text file easily, for instance, first German and then the English translation, „schlafen,to sleep“

Constraints

* .net 6, cross platform application. 
* First only console app
* Dockerized so it will work everywhere
* Docker image size must be as small as possible
* Word list csv file can be given outside, this also can be an excel file.
* %100 test coverage
* After every test, commit
* After implement every feature, commit
* After every refactor, commit
